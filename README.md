**Version 1.0**
This is my base app that will be used to communicate with our RPIs.
**Purpose:**
It pushes information assigned to each RPI to set reminders and different tasks in a given day. It is the hub for all RPI's to connect to when needing to push information all out at once. 

**Soon to come:**
A seperate repository for RPI's which will use AI/ML to detect different gestures, assign daily tasks and learn from the users habbits.
Have yet to organize files into assigned folders
